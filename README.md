# PartyButton
 The shiny red button tempts you. Uncork an instant party when you click it!

My first coding project, made using pygame. Constructive comments welcome!

Known issues: clickable surface does not exactly match the button location.

Features to add: 

-blinking text, possibly

-random choice of a few additional songs

-proper closeout function

-convert to apk for mobile android devices

-convert to web app
